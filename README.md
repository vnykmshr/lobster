# Lobster

> The stress tester that thinks like a user

**Lobster** is an intelligent web application stress testing tool that automatically discovers your application's URLs through crawling and validates performance under concurrent load. Unlike traditional stress testing tools that require manual URL configuration, Lobster explores your application like a real user would, providing comprehensive performance validation with zero configuration.

## Why Lobster?

Traditional stress testing tools are either too simple (just hammer a single endpoint) or too complex (requiring extensive scripting and setup). Lobster fills the gap:

- **Zero Configuration**: Point it at your app and go
- **Intelligent Discovery**: Automatically crawls and discovers all URLs
- **Production-Ready Validation**: Get clear pass/fail criteria, not just raw metrics
- **Beautiful Reports**: HTML and JSON reports with visualizations out of the box
- **Developer-Friendly**: Built for CI/CD pipelines and local development

## Features

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
go install github.com/vnykmshr/lobster/cmd/lobster@latest
```

Or clone and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vnykmshr/lobster.git
cd lobster
go build -o lobster cmd/lobster/main.go
```

### Basic Usage

Test your local application:

```bash
lobster -url http://localhost:3000
```

That's it! Lobster will:
1. Crawl your application starting from the base URL
2. Discover all linked pages
3. Generate concurrent requests
4. Validate performance
5. Generate beautiful HTML and JSON reports

### Common Use Cases

**Development Validation**
```bash
# Quick check during development
lobster -url http://localhost:3000 -duration 30s -concurrency 5
```

**Pre-Deployment Testing**
```bash
# Comprehensive test before release
lobster -url https://staging.example.com \
  -duration 10m \
  -concurrency 25 \
  -max-depth 5 \
  -output pre-deploy-results.json
```

**CI/CD Integration**
```bash
# Run in CI pipeline
lobster -url http://localhost:3000 \
  -duration 2m \
  -concurrency 10 \
  -output ci-results.json
```

**High-Load Stress Testing**
```bash
# Simulate high traffic
lobster -url https://example.com \
  -concurrency 100 \
  -duration 15m \
  -rate 50 \
  -output load-test.json
```

## Configuration

### Command-Line Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `-url` | `http://localhost:3000` | Base URL to test |
| `-concurrency` | `5` | Number of concurrent workers |
| `-duration` | `2m` | Test duration (e.g., 30s, 5m, 1h) |
| `-timeout` | `30s` | Request timeout |
| `-rate` | `2.0` | Requests per second limit |
| `-user-agent` | `Lobster/1.0` | User agent string |
| `-follow-links` | `true` | Follow links found in pages |
| `-max-depth` | `3` | Maximum crawl depth |
| `-output` | - | Output file for results (JSON) |
| `-verbose` | `false` | Verbose logging |
| `-config` | - | Path to configuration file |

### Configuration File

Create a JSON configuration file for complex scenarios:

```json
{
  "base_url": "http://localhost:3000",
  "concurrency": 20,
  "duration": "5m",
  "timeout": "30s",
  "rate": 10.0,
  "user_agent": "Lobster/1.0",
  "follow_links": true,
  "max_depth": 3,
  "output_file": "results.json",
  "verbose": true,
  "performance_targets": {
    "requests_per_second": 1000,
    "avg_response_time_ms": 30,
    "p95_response_time_ms": 50,
    "p99_response_time_ms": 100,
    "success_rate": 99.0,
    "error_rate": 1.0
  }
}
```

Use with:
```bash
lobster -config config.json
```

## How It Works

### 1. URL Discovery Phase
- Starts with the base URL
- Parses HTML responses for `<a href>` links
- Resolves relative URLs to absolute
- Filters to same-domain links only
- Maintains a queue of discovered URLs
- Respects max depth configuration

### 2. Concurrent Testing Phase
- Spawns configurable number of worker goroutines
- Distributes URLs across workers
- Applies rate limiting via token bucket
- Tracks response times and status codes
- Continues until duration expires

### 3. Analysis Phase
- Calculates aggregate metrics
- Computes percentiles (p95, p99)
- Validates against performance targets
- Identifies slow requests and errors

### 4. Reporting Phase
- Generates JSON output with detailed metrics
- Creates HTML report with interactive charts
- Provides console summary with pass/fail indicators
- Outputs actionable recommendations
