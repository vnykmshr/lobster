## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions
- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Run `go vet` before committing
- Keep functions focused and concise
- Add comments for exported functions

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functions
- Maintain test coverage >70%
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate

### Architecture

Lobster follows Clean Architecture:

```
internal/
├── domain/     # Core entities and business logic
├── crawler/    # URL discovery
├── tester/     # Load testing engine
├── reporter/   # Report generation
├── validator/  # Performance validation
└── config/     # Configuration management
```

- Keep domain logic independent
- Use interfaces for dependencies
- Avoid circular dependencies

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions/changes
- `chore`: Build/tooling changes

Examples:
```
feat(crawler): add support for JavaScript-rendered pages
fix(tester): correct percentile calculation
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature/fix
- Update relevant documentation
- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass
- Address review feedback promptly
- Squash commits before merging (if requested)
