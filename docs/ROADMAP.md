# Lobster Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the phased approach to maturing Lobster into a production-ready, feature-rich web stress testing tool. Each phase builds on the previous, delivering incremental value while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Guiding Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Zero-config should remain the default experience
- **Practical Features**: Every feature must solve a real user problem
- **Performance**: The tool itself must be fast and efficient
- **Extensibility**: Architecture supports plugins and customization
- **Stability**: Comprehensive testing and semantic versioning
