# Responsible Use Guidelines

## Introduction

Lobster is a powerful web application load testing tool designed to help developers and QA teams validate application performance. With great power comes great responsibility. This document outlines the legal, ethical, and technical guidelines for using Lobster responsibly.

**TL;DR**: Only test systems you own or have explicit written permission to test. Respect rate limits, robots.txt, and privacy. If in doubt, don't.

## Legal Requirements

### Authorization is MANDATORY

You MUST have explicit authorization before testing any system:

✅ **Authorized Use:**
- Your own applications and infrastructure
- Systems where you have written permission from the owner
- Penetration testing engagements with signed contracts
- Bug bounty programs that explicitly allow load testing
- Development and staging environments you control

❌ **Unauthorized Use (ILLEGAL):**
- Testing third-party websites without permission
- Load testing production systems without authorization
- "Testing" competitors' websites or services
- Academic research without proper ethical approval
- "Security testing" without a formal engagement

### Legal Consequences

Unauthorized load testing may violate:

- **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)** in the United States
- **Computer Misuse Act** in the United Kingdom
- **Criminal Code provisions** in other jurisdictions
- **Terms of Service** agreements
- **Cloud provider acceptable use policies**

Penalties can include:
- Criminal prosecution and fines
- Civil lawsuits for damages
- Loss of employment or contracts
- Permanent record affecting future opportunities

**When in doubt, get it in writing.** A simple email confirmation from a system owner can protect you legally.

## Ethical Guidelines

### Core Principles

1. **Minimize Harm**: Configure tests to avoid disrupting legitimate users
2. **Transparency**: Be clear about who you are and what you're testing
3. **Privacy**: Protect any data collected during testing
4. **Respect**: Honor robots.txt, rate limits, and server capacity
5. **Accountability**: Take responsibility for your testing activities

### Ethical Checklist

Before running a load test, ask yourself:

- [ ] Do I have explicit permission to test this system?
- [ ] Have I informed relevant stakeholders (operations, security teams)?
- [ ] Am I testing during appropriate hours to minimize user impact?
- [ ] Have I configured reasonable concurrency and rate limits?
- [ ] Am I testing non-production environments when possible?
- [ ] Do I have a plan to stop testing if issues arise?
- [ ] Am I prepared to share findings responsibly?

## Technical Best Practices

### 1. Respect robots.txt

Lobster respects robots.txt by default:

```bash
# Good: Respect robots.txt directives
lobster -url https://example.com

# Only override with explicit permission
lobster -url https://myapp.com -ignore-robots  # ⚠️ Use only on your own systems
```

**Why it matters**: robots.txt represents the website owner's preferences. Ignoring it without permission is disrespectful and potentially illegal.

### 2. Configure Appropriate Rate Limits

```bash
# Good: Reasonable rate for most applications
lobster -url https://example.com -rate 5 -concurrency 10

# Bad: Aggressive settings that could cause service disruption
lobster -url https://example.com -rate 1000 -concurrency 500  # ⚠️ DoS-like behavior
```

**Guidelines**:
- Start with low concurrency (5-10) and gradually increase
- Monitor server health during testing
- Respect HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses (enabled by default)
- Use dry-run mode first to understand request volume: `-dry-run`

### 3. Test Non-Production Environments

Whenever possible:
- Use staging or QA environments
- Create isolated test environments
- Avoid production testing during peak hours
- Get approval from operations teams before production testing

### 4. Use TLS Certificate Validation

```bash
# Good: Use proper TLS validation
lobster -url https://example.com

# Only disable for internal testing with self-signed certificates
lobster -url https://internal-test.local -insecure-skip-verify  # ⚠️ Development only
```

**Never** disable TLS verification when testing over untrusted networks.

### 5. Set Reasonable Test Durations

```bash
# Good: Short initial tests to validate configuration
lobster -url https://example.com -duration 30s

# Then increase duration as needed
lobster -url https://example.com -duration 10m

# Avoid: Extremely long tests without monitoring
lobster -url https://example.com -duration 24h  # ⚠️ Requires explicit approval
```

### 6. Monitor and Respond

During testing:
- Watch server metrics (CPU, memory, response times)
- Monitor error rates and adjust accordingly
- Be ready to stop testing immediately if issues arise
- Have communication channels open with operations teams

## What NOT to Do

### ❌ Forbidden Activities

1. **Testing Without Authorization**
   - Never test systems you don't own without written permission
   - Don't assume permission based on public accessibility

2. **Denial of Service Attacks**
   - Don't intentionally overwhelm servers to cause outages
   - Don't ignore signs of server distress (errors, timeouts)

3. **Bypassing Security Controls**
   - Don't disable robots.txt compliance without permission
   - Don't ignore rate limiting or IP blocking
   - Don't rotate IPs or use proxies to evade detection

4. **Testing in Production Without Approval**
   - Don't "surprise" your operations team with load tests
   - Don't test during critical business hours without coordination

5. **Exposing Sensitive Data**
   - Don't share test reports containing sensitive URLs or data
   - Don't commit reports with secrets to version control
   - Don't test with real user credentials or production data

6. **Ignoring Server Responses**
   - Don't continue testing when receiving 429 (rate limit) responses
   - Don't ignore 503 (service unavailable) responses
   - Don't disable `-respect-429` without good reason

## Data Privacy and Security

### Handling Test Results

Test reports may contain sensitive information:

**Sensitive Data in Reports:**
- URLs with API keys, tokens, or session IDs in query parameters
- Error messages revealing system internals
- Authentication headers and cookies
- Internal server paths and configurations

**Security Practices:**
- **Generate reports to secure locations** with proper file permissions (Lobster uses 0o600)
- **Sanitize URLs** before sharing reports externally
- **Don't commit reports** to version control systems
- **Delete reports** when no longer needed
- **Encrypt reports** if storing long-term
- **Review before sharing** - redact sensitive information

### Authentication in Tests

When testing authenticated endpoints:

```bash
# Use test accounts, never production user credentials
lobster -url https://example.com -auth-type bearer -auth-token "test_token_12345"

# Good: Create dedicated test users
# Bad: Using real user accounts
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use dedicated test accounts with limited privileges
- Never use real user credentials
- Rotate test credentials regularly
- Don't log credentials in reports or console output
- Use environment variables or secure vaults for credentials

### Privacy Considerations

- Test with synthetic data, not real user information
- Avoid testing pages that process personal data when possible
- Follow GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations
- Obtain consent if testing involves any real user data
- Have a data retention policy for test results

## Reporting Issues Responsibly

If you discover security vulnerabilities or performance issues:

### For Your Own Systems
1. Document findings with evidence
2. Prioritize based on severity
3. Work with teams to remediate
4. Retest after fixes are deployed

### For Third-Party Systems
1. **Stop testing immediately** if you find a vulnerability
2. Follow the organization's security disclosure policy
3. Use responsible disclosure practices:
   - Report privately to security contacts
   - Give reasonable time to fix (typically 90 days)
   - Don't publicly disclose until patched
4. Never exploit vulnerabilities you discover
5. Never demand payment or rewards (unless it's a bug bounty program)

## Consequences of Misuse

Misusing Lobster can result in:

**Legal Consequences:**
- Criminal charges and prosecution
- Civil lawsuits for damages caused
- Permanent criminal record
- Financial penalties and restitution

**Professional Consequences:**
- Termination of employment
- Loss of professional certifications
- Reputation damage
- Difficulty finding future employment

**Technical Consequences:**
- IP address blacklisting
- Network access revocation
- Account terminations
- Service bans

**We do not condone misuse of this tool.** Users are solely responsible for their actions.

## Educational Use

### For Students and Researchers

If using Lobster for academic purposes:

✅ **Appropriate Use:**
- Testing your own course projects
- Lab environments specifically designed for testing
- Research with institutional ethics board approval
- Bug bounty programs that welcome researchers

❌ **Inappropriate Use:**
- Testing university systems without permission ("testing" the school website)
- Research projects without ethics approval

- May require security team approval
- Avoid testing during market hours
- Special data privacy requirements

### Healthcare
- HIPAA compliance requirements
- Never test with real patient data
- Requires heightened security measures
- May need legal review

### E-commerce
- Avoid testing during peak sales periods
- Don't test checkout flows without approval
- Be mindful of inventory systems
- Consider impact on analytics

### Government Systems
- May require special authorization
- Higher legal scrutiny
- Stricter security requirements
- Coordinate with security operations centers

## Getting Help

If you're unsure whether your use case is appropriate:

1. **Consult your legal team** - When in doubt, ask your organization's legal counsel
2. **Contact the system owner** - Get written permission via email
3. **Review terms of service** - Check if load testing is explicitly forbidden
4. **Start small** - Begin with minimal impact and scale up with approval
5. **Document everything** - Keep records of approvals and communications
